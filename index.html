<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a PhD student at Imperial College London researching Financial Machine Learning in the Intelligent Systems & Networks Group, supervised by Dr Giunchiglia. My research focuses on developing architecture-agnostic neurosymbolic layers for knowledge-constrained structured output prediction, with applications to asset allocation and ETF construction.</p>

<p>Previously, I completed my BA and MEng in Information & Computer Engineering at the University of Cambridge and worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at Neuphonic, where I researched stability and robustness for Speech-Language Models.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Neurosymbolic Reasoning and knowledge-constrained prediction</li>
  <li>Financial machine learning and portfolio optimization</li>
</ul>
